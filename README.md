EMOJI Classifier! :)
Implemeted on Jupter Notebook.
I scraped four EMOJI sheets from four vendors: facebook, twitter, apple and google. 
I then applied several models to classify the EMOJIS. All with the help of Sci-kit Learn.
Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine.
